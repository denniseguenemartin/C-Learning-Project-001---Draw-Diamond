# C++-Learning-Project-001---Draw-Diamond

# A Note About the Files
There are two attempts at this project contained in this repository. The first one which is comprised of source.cpp and
a std lib header file is the first attempt at this project and learning C++. I took a two year hiatus after learning some 
programming and to refresh myself I worked through my original projects. The revised attempt is that effort.

# Draw Diamond Project Notes
This project prompts the user for the size of a diamond height and then draws a custom diamond shape on console
to that specification.
